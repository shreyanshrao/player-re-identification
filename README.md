# ðŸŽ¥ Multi-Camera Player Tracking and Re-Identification

This project tracks and identifies players across two different video feeds using computer vision techniques. It uses:

- **YOLOv8** for person detection
- **DeepSORT** for tracking each player in a video
- **Cosine Similarity** for matching players across different cameras
- **Global ID Mapping** to assign consistent IDs to the same player across feeds
